Hey DAON,

 - Project is built with AdoptOpenJDK 1.8.0_265;

 - To start project project first run -> mvn clean install
   - Or if you want to skip unit tests -> mvn clean install -DskipTests

 - Create a run configuration as run project:
   - option 1, navigate to AirportGateApplication and just click run
   - option 2, create SpringBoot run configuration, set AirportGateApplication as main class and root directory as working directory
   - make sure java 1.8 is set as JRE

 - To test application:
    1. To assign flight to gate, call POST: http://localhost:8080/gate/assign/{flightNumber}
        - You will get response with data about assigned gate
        - In case of invalid data:
            - no gates are available /
            - flight already assigned to gate /
            - request flight number is blank
          You will get an error response with description what data was invalid

    2. To free up a gate, call PATCH: http://localhost:8080/gate/free/{gateCode}
        - You will receive response with data describing if gate with code was successfully freed
        - In case no gate were found, or gateCode in request was blank,
          you will receive error response with description what data was invalid

    3. To update gate availability time, call PATCH: http://localhost:8080/gate/update
        - Request body example:
            {
                "gateCode"      : "A2",
                "availableFrom" : "2021-05-29T18:00:00",
                "availableTo"   : "2021-08-10T23:59:59"
            }
        - You will receive response with data describing if gate with code was successfully updated
        - In case of invalid data:
            - no gate was found for gateCode /
            - no availableFrom data was set /
            - no availableTo data was set /
            - availableFrom is greater then availableTo /
            - request body was null
              You will get an error response with description what data was invalid

    4. Additionally, I added an endpoint to get all gates at GET: http://localhost:8080/gate/findAll
        - You will receive response of all gates
        - In case of no gates persisted you will get an error response

    - There is an postman collection attached for easier testing at root_directory/src/main/postmanCollections
    - DB is prefilled with data from data.sql file
